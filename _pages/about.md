I am a Ph.D. student at [Tri-Institutional Computational Biology & Medicine](https://compbio.triiprograms.org/) (hosted by Cornell University & MSKCC & Rockefeller University), currently rotating with Prof. [Dana Pe'er](https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski/labs/dana-pe-er). Previously, I was a visiting scholar at Stanford University through UGVR program, advised by Prof. [Bo Wang](https://wanglab.stanford.edu/). 

I received my Bachelor's degree with honors from Zhili College, Tsinghua University. During my undergraduate years, I was honored to be advised by Prof. [Stephen Shing-Toung Yau](https://www.math.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1125/2065.htm) from Department of Mathematical Sciences and Prof. [Bryan Wei](https://life.tsinghua.edu.cn/lifeen/info/1034/1078.htm) from School of Life Sciences.

Research Overview
------
I am currently a Ph.D. student with a focus on computational biology, bioinformatics, and the application of deep learning to biological research. My work spans several interdisciplinary projects that leverage advanced computational methods, including machine learning, natural language processing, and mathematical modeling, to address biological challenges.

In my research on AI for Biology, I have contributed to several projects that integrate machine learning with genomic analysis. Notably, I developed kmer2vec, a novel approach for comparing DNA sequences using NLP methods, which was applied to phylogenetic analysis and SARS-CoV-2 typing. Additionally, I constructed a deep learning model CAPE for prokaryotic promoter evolution that was successfully validated through biological experiments.

In my work on experimental method development, I designed software tools to assist in DNA sequence assembly, contributing to the development of ModAssembly and NanoStructure, both of which were deployed as web-based tools. In the realm of biomathematics and data analysis, I explored genome geometric spaces to study protozoan genome structures. I also conducted research on the analysis of codon adaptation index in HIV and SARS-CoV-2.

My research aims to bridge computational techniques with biological discovery, improving our understanding of genomic evolution, gene regulation, develepmental biology, and disease mechanisms through innovative models and software tools.

I am a Ph.D. student at [Tri-Institutional Computational Biology & Medicine](https://compbio.triiprograms.org/) (hosted by Cornell University & MSKCC & Rockefeller University), advised by Prof. [Christina Leslie](https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski/labs/christina-leslie). Previously, I was a visiting scholar at Stanford University through [UGVR program](https://engineering.stanford.edu/students-academics/global-engineering-programs/chinese-undergraduate-visiting-research-program), advised by Prof. [Bo Wang](https://wanglab.stanford.edu/). 

I received my Bachelor's degree with honors from Zhili College, Tsinghua University. During my undergraduate years, I was honored to be advised by Prof. [Stephen Shing-Toung Yau](https://www.bimsa.cn/detail/stephenyau.html) from Department of Mathematical Sciences and Prof. [Bryan Wei](https://life.tsinghua.edu.cn/lifeen/info/1034/1078.htm) from School of Life Sciences.

Research Overview
------
I am currently a Ph.D. student with a focus on computational biology, bioinformatics, and the application of deep learning to biological research. My work spans several interdisciplinary projects that leverage advanced computational methods, including machine learning, natural language processing, and mathematical modeling, to address biological challenges.

In my research on AI for Biology, I have contributed to several projects that integrate machine learning with genomic analysis. Notably, I developed kmer2vec, a novel approach for comparing DNA sequences using NLP methods, which was applied to phylogenetic analysis and SARS-CoV-2 typing. Additionally, I constructed a deep learning model CAPE for prokaryotic promoter evolution that was successfully validated through biological experiments.

My research aims to bridge computational techniques with biological discovery, improving our understanding of genomic evolution, gene regulation, developmental biology, and disease mechanisms through innovative models and software tools.
